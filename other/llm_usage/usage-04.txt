The pricing of grocery products, particularly beef, plays a significant role in understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics within the Canadian retail sector. Beef, as a staple of many households, exhibits complex pricing behaviors influenced by a variety of factors, including vendor strategies [@citePricingStrategies], historical pricing, and seasonal trends [@citeSeasonal]. The broader context for this study lies in exploring how large-scale retailers and specialty stores adjust their beef prices over time and how these changes reflect broader economic and cultural trends. Given the increasing concerns around food affordability and accessibility, understanding the dynamics of beef pricing is not only crucial for consumers but also for stakeholders involved in food distribution and policy-making.

This paper specifically focuses on two prominent vendors, Walmart and T&T, to examine how beef pricing varies across different types of retail environments. Walmart, as a major multinational retailer, represents mainstream [@citeWalmart], standardized pricing strategies, while T&T, catering primarily to Asian communities, represents a more specialized market segment [@citeTandT]. By analyzing data from these two vendors, this paper aims to address an important gap in understanding how cultural preferences and retail strategies influence product pricing. While previous studies have highlighted general trends in food pricing, they often overlook the nuanced differences between general retail chains and culturally specific stores. This paper fills that gap by providing an in-depth analysis of beef pricing patterns across these two distinct retail settings.

The estimand of this study is the current price of beef, determined by factors such as vendor type, historical pricing, etc. By estimating how these variables impact the current pricing, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pricing mechanisms that affect retail beef prices in Canada.

Using a Bayesian linear regression approach, this study examines the effect of historical pricing, vendor-specific strategies, and seasonal factors on current beef prices. The analysis finds that old prices significantly predict current pricing, indicating a high degree of price consistency. Additionally, notable differences in pricing strategies between Walmart and T&T suggest that these vendors approach their markets with distinct pricing objectives, with Walmart favoring price stability and T&T showing more variability in pricing, possibly to cater to niche preferences. The findings are significant as they reveal the underlying mechanisms of price determination in a diverse retail environment, highlighting both market-wide factors and vendor-specific influences. Such insights could be useful for retailers looking to optimize their pricing strategies and for policymakers interested in addressing food affordability concerns.

The structure of the paper is organized as follows: @sec-data outlines the data collection and cleaning process, along with a description of the outcome and predictor variables used in the analysis. @sec-model introduces the forecasting models and discusses the rationale behind choosing these models for beef pricing prediction. @sec-result then presents the main findings, including a breakdown of vendor-level pricing effects and seasonal trends. Finally, @sec-discussion interprets the results, highlighting significant trends, comparing vendor strategies, and discussing potential limitations of the analysis.

Treating month as a categorical variable allows for the identification of months with higher or lower prices, potentially tied to changes in demand due to holidays, promotions, or seasonal supply fluctuations. For instance, months associated with holidays like Thanksgiving or cultural festivals may show increased demand, which could lead to price adjustments. This temporal perspective helps to assess whether vendors apply seasonal pricing strategies that influence current_price over time.

The table shows the count of observations for each month, from June to November, with the highest number recorded in August (624) and the lowest in November (342). This variation suggests increased data collection or market activity during the summer months, likely reflecting consumer demand during barbecue season, while the dip in November could indicate reduced data collection or shifts in consumer behavior. Since data collection began earlier in 2024, it does not cover the entire year, which limits the ability to analyze pricing trends comprehensively across all seasons. The differences in monthly counts emphasize the need to consider seasonal factors when interpreting pricing trends.

The choice of predictors is well-balanced in terms of complexity and appropriateness for this scenario. By including month and vendor as categorical variables, we acknowledge the significant impact that both seasonal changes and vendor-specific factors can have on the current price of beef. The inclusion of the old price reflects the idea of price inertia, where historical prices are likely to influence current pricing trends.

The model is neither overly simplistic nor unnecessarily complex: it captures important predictors without adding extraneous complexity that could lead to overfitting. Month and vendor are treated as categorical variables rather than grouping by more arbitrary categories, which maintains the expressiveness of our model while being parsimonious.

- **Linearity**: The model assumes a linear relationship between the predictors (month, old_price, vendor) and the response variable (current_price). This assumption simplifies the model and makes it more interpretable, but it may also be a limitation if the true relationship between these variables is nonlinear. For instance, there could be interactions or threshold effects that are not captured by a linear model. If these nonlinear relationships are present but not modeled, the estimates and predictions may be inaccurate, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about the factors influencing beef pricing.

- **Normality of Residuals**: The residuals are assumed to follow a normal distribution, which is critical for making valid statistical inferences about the model parameters. If this assumption does not hold, for example, if the residuals are skewed or exhibit heavy tails, it could lead to biased estimates and inaccurate confidence intervals, ultimately affecting the reliability of the model’s predictions. Non-normal residuals may indicate that some important variables are missing from the model or that a different type of model (e.g., a generalized linear model) would be more appropriate.

- **Priors**: In this Bayesian framework, we used weakly informative priors to allow flexibility, meaning the priors did not overly constrain the parameter estimates. This choice allows the data to have a significant influence on the results. However, if we had more specific prior knowledge of pricing patterns, more informative priors could have been employed to improve the model’s inference, potentially leading to more precise parameter estimates. The use of weakly informative priors also means that the model could be more sensitive to the data quality and outliers, as the priors do not provide strong guidance. Incorporating stronger, well-justified priors could help stabilize the estimates, especially in cases of limited or noisy data.

Linearity: The model assumes a linear relationship between the predictors (month, old_price, vendor) and the response variable (current_price). This assumption simplifies the analysis and enhances interpretability, but it may limit the model's ability to capture more complex relationships. For example, interactions or threshold effects between predictors and the response variable would not be reflected in a purely linear framework. If these nonlinear relationships exist but are not modeled, the resulting estimates and predictions may be less accurate, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about factors affecting beef pricing.

Normality of Residuals: The residuals are assumed to follow a normal distribution, a requirement for making valid statistical inferences about model parameters. If this assumption is violated—such as when residuals are skewed or have heavy tails—it could result in biased estimates, unreliable confidence intervals, and less dependable predictions. Non-normal residuals might suggest missing variables in the model or that a different modeling approach, such as a generalized linear model, might better fit the data.

Priors: The Bayesian framework employs weakly informative priors to allow the data to primarily determine parameter estimates. While this provides flexibility, it also means that stronger prior knowledge of pricing patterns could have been used to improve precision. Using more specific priors, informed by domain knowledge, might enhance the model's performance by producing more stable estimates. However, weakly informative priors can make the model more sensitive to data quality and outliers, as they do not strongly influence the parameter estimates. In cases where the data are limited or noisy, stronger priors could help stabilize the model's outputs.

Paragraphs to edit, do not change the .rmd format:- **Posterior Predictive Checks**: We performed posterior predictive checks to verify that the model adequately captures the variation in the data. These checks involve comparing simulated data from the posterior distribution to the observed data to check for any discrepancies. By comparing the distributions, we can assess whether the model's predictions align well with the actual data. A good match between the observed and simulated data suggests that the model is effectively capturing the underlying structure, whereas significant discrepancies could indicate issues with the model, such as missing variables or incorrect functional forms. Posterior predictive checks are an important part of validating the model's ability to generalize beyond the observed dataset.

- **Convergence**: Model convergence was assessed using trace plots and the R-hat statistic, with all values being close to 1, indicating successful convergence. Trace plots help visualize how well the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm has explored the parameter space, with well-mixed chains and stable trajectories suggesting that the model has reached a stationary distribution. The R-hat statistic, also known as the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic, measures the ratio of between-chain variance to within-chain variance, with values close to 1 indicating that all chains have converged to the same target distribution. Together, these diagnostics give confidence that the model results are reliable and that parameter estimates are not unduly influenced by sampling issues.

- **Alternative Models**: We also considered fitting simpler linear models that did not include the vendor or seasonal components. These models showed significantly lower predictive performance, indicating the importance of including both the vendor and seasonal factors for accuracy. The exclusion of these variables led to a decrease in model fit, as measured by metrics such as R-squared and predictive accuracy, suggesting that vendor-specific effects and seasonal variations are crucial for understanding beef pricing dynamics. By comparing these alternative models, we were able to validate our choice of predictors and ensure that the final model adequately captures the factors driving price changes in the dataset.

In summary, the chosen model provides a comprehensive yet interpretable understanding of how different factors influence the current price of beef. The Bayesian approach allows us to incorporate uncertainty and prior beliefs, while our specific choice of priors and predictors ensures that the model is well-suited for the available data and research questions.

Posterior Predictive Checks: Posterior predictive checks were conducted to evaluate how well the model represents the variation in the data. These checks compare simulated data generated from the posterior distribution to the observed data to identify any discrepancies. Assessing the alignment between these distributions helps determine whether the model captures the underlying patterns in the data. A close match indicates that the model is appropriately capturing the structure of the data, while notable differences may suggest issues such as omitted variables or an incorrect model specification. These checks are a key step in validating the model's ability to generalize beyond the observed dataset.

Convergence: Model convergence was assessed using trace plots and the R-hat statistic, with all R-hat values near 1, confirming successful convergence. Trace plots illustrate how effectively the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm explores the parameter space. Well-mixed chains with stable trajectories suggest the model has reached a stationary distribution. The R-hat statistic, also known as the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic, compares between-chain and within-chain variance, with values close to 1 indicating that all chains have converged to the same target distribution. Together, these diagnostics ensure the reliability of the parameter estimates and confirm that sampling issues did not influence the results.

Alternative Models: Simpler linear models excluding vendor or seasonal variables were also tested. These models showed notably lower predictive performance, highlighting the importance of including both vendor and seasonal factors for accurate modeling. Excluding these variables reduced the model's fit, as indicated by metrics like R-squared and predictive accuracy. This comparison reinforces the necessity of accounting for vendor-specific strategies and seasonal variations to effectively model beef pricing. The evaluation of alternative models confirmed that the selected predictors provide a better representation of the factors influencing price changes in the dataset.

In conclusion, the chosen model effectively captures how various factors influence the current price of beef.

@tbl-modelresults summarizes the results from the Bayesian model applied to analyze beef prices, providing key parameter estimates and model diagnostics. The model explores the relationship between the current price of beef and predictors such as the old price, vendor, and time of observation (represented by the "month" variable).

The estimated intercept of -0.37 suggests that, after accounting for the predictors, the baseline level of the current price is negative. While this may seem counterintuitive, it primarily serves as a reference point within the model and requires contextual interpretation. The "month" coefficient of -0.01 indicates a slight downward trend in current prices over time, reflecting potential seasonal effects or market adjustments, though the magnitude of this effect is small. The "old_price" coefficient, at 0.81, shows a strong positive relationship, suggesting that higher historical prices lead to proportionally higher current prices, emphasizing price consistency over time. Meanwhile, the "vendorWalmart" coefficient of 0.56 implies that, on average, Walmart’s beef prices are higher than those at the baseline vendor, T&T, consistent with earlier findings regarding vendor-specific pricing strategies.

Regarding model fit, the R-squared (R²) value of 0.945 and adjusted R² of 0.944 demonstrate that the model explains a significant portion of the variance in beef prices. The negative log-likelihood (-4349.672) and the expected log pointwise predictive density (ELPD) of -4354.7 further confirm the model's adequacy in capturing the underlying patterns in the data. Out-of-sample predictive metrics such as the leave-one-out information criterion (LOOIC) and Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC), both around 8709, reinforce the model's predictive reliability. The root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.02 indicates that predictions deviate minimally from observed values on average, underscoring the model's accuracy.

These results confirm a strong and systematic relationship between historical and current pricing and reveal meaningful differences in vendor strategies. By leveraging a Bayesian framework, the analysis accommodates uncertainty and provides robust parameter estimates. The high degree of explained variance and solid predictive metrics highlight the model’s effectiveness in analyzing and forecasting beef price trends, offering valuable insights for both consumers and market stakeholders.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Interpretation of Findings

The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the dynamics of beef pricing in the Canadian grocery market. Through the application of Bayesian linear regression, it is evident that both historical pricing (i.e., old_price) and vendor-specific strategies significantly influence the current pricing of beef. The strong positive correlation between old_price and current_price suggests a consistency in pricing practices, potentially driven by factors like inflation and vendor pricing strategies, with beef products generally following historical pricing trends. The vendor effect, notably the difference between T&T and Walmart, reflects distinct market positioning strategies, with Walmart generally maintaining a more standardized pricing approach, whereas T&T displays greater variability, possibly influenced by its focus on specialty goods catering to specific cultural preferences. Seasonal trends, captured through the month variable, also indicate minor temporal price variations, pointing to possible supply and demand effects linked to particular times of the year.

The heatmap visualizations, scatter plots, and statistical summaries all pointed towards a consistent trend in pricing, with limited deviations from expected relationships between historical and current prices. The consistency observed in the heatmap between old and current price levels suggests that vendors are either directly responding to historical costs or that other external factors, such as cost of production, inflation, or market demand, are similarly affecting historical and current pricing. The results of the Bayesian model further support these findings, highlighting the importance of including historical price as a predictor in understanding current pricing trends. The high R-squared value of the model also indicates that the chosen predictors adequately capture most of the variability in beef prices, reinforcing the relevance of the variables selected.

## Vendor-Specific Pricing Strategies

One critical point of discussion is the apparent distinction in pricing strategies between Walmart and T&T. Walmart's pricing, as evidenced by the relatively narrow spread of the boxplot, seems to prioritize consistency and predictability, possibly reflecting its brand strategy of offering everyday low prices [@citeWalmartLowPrice]. This approach may be designed to build consumer trust, ensuring customers that they are receiving competitive pricing without frequent fluctuations. On the other hand, T&T's wider range of price differences may reflect a more dynamic pricing strategy, potentially influenced by the specialty nature of its products [@citeTandT], diverse supply chain, or its responsiveness to a different customer demographic. Such variability in pricing could indicate promotional efforts, targeted price differentiation, or a reflection of its broader range of product quality and types.

This analysis highlights the importance of understanding different vendor strategies when interpreting pricing data. Walmart's emphasis on standardized pricing could attract a broader, price-sensitive customer base, while T&T's more variable pricing might appeal to niche customers seeking specific products, regardless of price changes. Future research could delve deeper into these strategies by including additional variables that capture product-specific characteristics, customer demographics, or promotion periods to better understand the pricing differences observed.

## Price Stability and Market Forces

The study also suggests that beef pricing is relatively stable, with most price adjustments being proportional to historical prices. This stability might imply a well-functioning market where historical prices act as an anchor, helping vendors and consumers set expectations. This could also be indicative of supply-side factors such as contracts with suppliers or production costs that do not fluctuate significantly. Additionally, the moderate decrease in prices observed during certain months might suggest seasonal promotions or shifts in consumer demand that lead vendors to adjust prices accordingly. Such trends could be driven by factors like increased competition, holiday promotions [@citeHoliday], or seasonal variations in meat consumption.

Interestingly, the observed concentration of prices in the lower range might indicate that the majority of beef products are targeted towards value-oriented consumers, potentially reflecting broader consumer preferences or economic constraints. This could also point to the influence of retailer pricing power, where large players like Walmart are able to leverage economies of scale to keep prices low, thereby shaping overall market dynamics. An important next step in understanding these patterns would be to assess how external shocks, such as economic downturns or supply chain disruptions [@citeSupplyChain], influence this pricing stability, as well as whether similar patterns hold for other product categories.

## Cultural Preferences and Product Differentiation

The analysis also sheds light on the influence of cultural preferences on beef pricing. T&T, which primarily serves an Asian customer base, appears to have more varied pricing patterns, which could be linked to the type of products offered and the specific culinary needs of its consumers. This variability may be a reflection of the higher diversity of product cuts or grades that cater to specific cultural dishes, which could require different sourcing methods and thereby lead to greater price variation. Understanding these cultural influences can provide key insights into the broader market, highlighting how demographic factors shape retail strategies and pricing practices.

For policymakers or retailers looking to address food affordability, these findings underscore the need to consider cultural nuances in consumption patterns. Retailers like T&T that offer specialty products may require tailored pricing strategies that reflect their diverse product offerings, whereas larger chains like Walmart might benefit from maintaining uniform pricing across broader product categories to appeal to a mass market.

## Promotional Strategies and Consumer Behavior

Another noteworthy aspect involves the impact of promotional strategies on beef pricing. The variability observed in T&T's pricing could also be attributed to frequent promotional activities aimed at attracting specific customer segments. Promotions might be used to move surplus inventory, introduce new products, or respond to competitor pricing. This contrasts with Walmart's strategy, which appears to focus more on price stability rather than frequent discounting.

Consumer behavior likely plays a significant role in shaping these strategies. Price-sensitive shoppers may prefer Walmart due to its consistent pricing, while customers seeking specialty products or unique cuts may be drawn to T&T, despite potential price fluctuations. Future studies could explore the role of promotions more explicitly by analyzing temporal pricing data in conjunction with promotional calendars or sales events, thereby providing a clearer picture of how short-term discounts influence long-term pricing trends and consumer loyalty.

## Weaknesses and Future Directions

While the study offers useful insights into beef pricing dynamics, it is important to acknowledge several limitations. First, the dataset used was limited to two vendors, Walmart and T&T, which may not fully represent the diversity of the Canadian grocery market. Including more vendors could provide a broader perspective on pricing strategies across different types of retailers, such as discount chains, premium grocers, or independent stores [@citeBrand]. Additionally, the current analysis did not account for factors like promotions, product quality differences, or customer loyalty programs [@citeProgram], which could play significant roles in pricing decisions. Including such variables in future models could provide a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing beef prices.

The model assumes a linear relationship between predictors and the outcome variable, which might oversimplify the complexity of real-world pricing behavior. Future work could explore more sophisticated modeling techniques, such as non-linear models or machine learning approaches, to capture potential non-linearities in the data. Additionally, the study relied on a single dataset, and incorporating external data sources—such as economic indicators, weather data, or detailed sales information—could help validate and enrich the findings.

Finally, the assumption of constant variance and normality of residuals may not hold perfectly in the context of pricing data, which can often exhibit heteroscedasticity or other forms of non-normality. Implementing more robust regression techniques or exploring heteroscedasticity-consistent estimators could help improve model reliability and accuracy. Another interesting avenue for future research would be to examine the impact of consumer behavior changes, such as shifts towards plant-based alternatives, on beef pricing trends, which could provide insights into evolving market dynamics.

Interpretation of Findings
The findings of this study provide a detailed look into the factors influencing beef pricing in the Canadian grocery market. Using Bayesian linear regression, the results demonstrate that historical pricing (old_price) and vendor-specific strategies are significant predictors of current prices. The strong positive relationship between old_price and current_price suggests a high level of consistency in pricing practices, likely influenced by factors such as inflation or vendor strategies. Walmart and T&T exhibit distinct pricing approaches, with Walmart showing more consistent pricing while T&T displays greater variability, possibly due to its focus on specialty goods catering to specific cultural preferences. Seasonal trends, represented by the month variable, indicate small but noticeable temporal price variations, likely linked to supply and demand fluctuations throughout the year.

Visualizations such as heatmaps and scatter plots, combined with statistical summaries, support these findings. The heatmap shows a clear alignment between old and current prices, reinforcing the idea that historical costs significantly impact current pricing. Factors such as production costs, inflation, or market demand appear to influence both historical and current prices similarly. The high R-squared value of the Bayesian model further validates that the predictors effectively explain most of the variation in beef prices, underscoring their relevance.

Vendor-Specific Pricing Strategies
A key observation is the clear difference in pricing strategies between Walmart and T&T. Walmart’s pricing strategy, as reflected by its narrower boxplot range, emphasizes consistency and predictability, aligning with its branding as a retailer offering everyday low prices [@citeWalmartLowPrice]. This approach likely appeals to price-sensitive consumers seeking stability and affordability. In contrast, T&T shows a wider range of price differences, which may reflect a dynamic pricing strategy tailored to its specialty products, diverse supply chain, and specific customer demographic [@citeTandT]. The variability in T&T’s pricing could stem from promotional efforts, targeted price differentiation, or a wider range of product qualities and types.

Understanding these strategies is essential for interpreting pricing data. Walmart’s standardized pricing is likely to attract a broad customer base, while T&T’s variability might appeal to niche markets looking for specialty goods. Future research could expand on these findings by incorporating product-level details, customer demographics, or promotional data to better understand the drivers behind these pricing differences.

Price Stability and Market Forces
The study highlights a general stability in beef pricing, with adjustments largely proportional to historical prices. This stability may suggest a well-functioning market where historical prices act as an anchor for setting current prices, potentially influenced by supplier contracts or steady production costs. The modest decline in prices observed in certain months could reflect seasonal promotions or changes in demand, driven by factors like holiday sales [@citeHoliday] or shifts in meat consumption habits.

The clustering of prices at the lower end of the range suggests that the majority of beef products cater to value-conscious consumers, which may reflect broader economic trends or retailer strategies to maintain affordability. Larger players like Walmart might use economies of scale to keep prices competitive, shaping market dynamics as a result. To build on these findings, future studies could investigate how external events, such as economic downturns or supply chain disruptions [@citeSupplyChain], affect this pricing stability and whether similar patterns are observed in other product categories.

Cultural Preferences and Product Differentiation
Cultural preferences play a significant role in beef pricing, as evidenced by the differences between T&T and Walmart. T&T’s pricing patterns, which are more varied, may reflect its focus on serving an Asian customer base with specific culinary needs. The diversity in its product cuts and grades could contribute to these patterns, as sourcing requirements and preparation methods may differ based on cultural preferences. This may lead to higher variability in prices.

For policymakers and retailers addressing food affordability, these findings underscore the importance of considering cultural factors in consumption patterns. Retailers like T&T, which cater to specific demographic groups, might need tailored pricing strategies, while larger chains like Walmart could focus on maintaining uniform pricing to appeal to a broader market.

Promotional Strategies and Consumer Behavior
Promotional strategies also play a role in shaping beef prices. T&T’s greater variability could reflect frequent promotional activities aimed at specific customer segments. Promotions may be used to move inventory, introduce new products, or compete with other retailers. This contrasts with Walmart’s approach, which prioritizes stable pricing over frequent discounts.

Consumer preferences likely influence these strategies. Price-sensitive shoppers may gravitate toward Walmart for its predictable pricing, while those seeking specialty cuts or products may prefer T&T, even with its price fluctuations. Future research could examine the impact of promotions by analyzing temporal pricing data alongside promotional calendars or sales events to better understand how short-term discounts affect pricing patterns and consumer loyalty.

Weaknesses and Future Directions
While this study provides a useful analysis of beef pricing dynamics, it has some limitations. First, the dataset includes only two vendors, Walmart and T&T, which may not fully represent the diversity of the Canadian grocery market. Expanding the study to include additional retailers, such as discount chains, premium grocers, or independent stores [@citeBrand], could offer a broader perspective. Additionally, the analysis does not account for factors like promotions, product quality, or customer loyalty programs [@citeProgram], which could significantly influence pricing. Future models incorporating these variables could provide a deeper understanding of pricing behavior.

The assumption of a linear relationship between predictors and the outcome may oversimplify the complexity of real-world pricing. Future studies could explore more flexible modeling techniques, such as non-linear models or machine learning approaches, to better capture these relationships. Incorporating external data sources, such as economic indicators, weather patterns, or detailed sales records, could further validate and enrich the findings.

Finally, the assumptions of constant variance and normality of residuals may not hold perfectly in pricing data, which often exhibit heteroscedasticity or other deviations. Employing more robust regression techniques or heteroscedasticity-consistent estimators could improve model accuracy and reliability. An interesting avenue for future research would be to explore the impact of shifts in consumer preferences, such as increased demand for plant-based alternatives, on beef pricing trends, providing insight into evolving market dynamics.

Visualizations in previous section (@sec-result), combined with statistical summaries, support these findings. The @fig-current_vs_old_price shows a clear alignment between old and current prices, reinforcing the idea that historical costs significantly impact current pricing. Factors such as production costs, inflation, or market demand appear to influence both historical and current prices similarly. The high R-squared value of the Bayesian model (@tbl-modelresults) further validates that the predictors effectively explain most of the variation in beef prices, underscoring their relevance. Below are more findings could be infer from our results.
